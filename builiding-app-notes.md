## Terminal Commands

`npm init` get inside the folder and it will build out package.json

`npm install express --save` create express app (also package lock and save dependencies in package)

`nodemon app` acts like rails s where it reacts with the changes made and you don't have to keep closing and opening with every change (node app.js does not update while running)

## Building the Express App
- require the express app
- app listen sets up a portal
- graphql hasn't been set up
